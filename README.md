# Data-Science-and-Computational-Tools-Python-Programming
This repository contains Python implementations of various computational and data science tasks, completed as part of an academic assignment. The assignment covers smart text processing, classic games, prime number computations, temperature analysis, system of linear equations, and synthetic dataset generation with visualization.

## üìå Assignment Tasks Overview

### 1. Smart Text-Processing Tool
A dynamic tool for formatting text based on a registration number:
- Even number: Reverse string (mirror view).
- Odd number: Convert vowels to uppercase, consonants to lowercase.
- Substring extraction based on binary representation.
- Sort substrings based on bitwise AND condition.

### 2. Rock-Paper-Scissors Game
A CLI-based game between user and computer:
- Accepts user input (`Rock`, `Paper`, or `Scissors`).
- Computer makes a random choice.
- Tracks score (wins, losses, ties).
- Supports continuous rounds until user quits.

### 3. Prime Number Sum using Sieve of Eratosthenes
Efficiently computes the sum of the first `n` prime numbers using the sieve method.

### 4. Temperature Data Analysis
Analyzes temperature readings over several days:
- Computes mean, median, standard deviation, and **sample** variance.
- Handles edge cases such as empty or single-entry datasets.

### 5. Solving a System of Linear Equations
Solves the matrix equation `AX = B` using NumPy.
- Handles singular matrix errors gracefully.

### 6. Synthetic Environmental Dataset Generator & Visualizer
Generates a customizable dataset for environmental analysis:
- Random function of form: `Y = Af‚ÇÅ(BX) + Cf‚ÇÇ(DX) + Ef‚ÇÉ(FX)`
- Randomly chooses functions from: `sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `log`, `square`, `cube`.
- Allows user to define:
  - Number of data points (N)
  - Range of X values
- Visualizations:
  - Scatter plot of X vs Y
  - Histogram of X
  - Box plot of Y
  - Line plot of sorted X vs Y
